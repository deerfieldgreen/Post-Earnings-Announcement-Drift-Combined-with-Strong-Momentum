Different variations of post earnings algorithm
The options v1 working.py is the most up to date and working algorithm. It has working call options that is bought 4 days before the earnings date and sold on the earnings date. It opens and closes positions at optimal times during that day, and right now is only buying one contract for each option contract. This algorithm also only trades options.

options trading.py is an older options trading algorithm, the first algorithm I got to trade options, however it was buying and selling options in the wrong order.
